    /// Since 2026-10-11 the list holds DocumentLocatorSvc: KitveiHakodeshSvc owns the file
    /// index, the package no longer ships DocumentLocator.Service.exe, and nothing re-registers
    /// it. The mechanism is SCM-direct deletion that needs no cooperation from the retired
    /// binary. The installer is asInvoker, so this step deletes only on an already-elevated
    /// run; the normal path is KitveiHakodeshService.exe --install, which retires
    /// DocumentLocatorSvc in the SAME elevated run that registers the new service (one UAC
    /// prompt for the whole switch - see KitveiHakodeshServiceHelper.EnsureServiceInstalledAsync).
    ///
    /// Why this exists separately from <see cref="KitveiHakodeshServiceHelper"/>:
    /// that helper delegates registration to the service exe itself
    /// (<c>DocumentLocator.Service.exe --install</c>). That approach cannot retire a
    /// service, because on the very update that drops a service the exe is no longer
    /// in the package — there is nothing left to run <c>--uninstall</c>. Worse, the
    /// copy already on disk gets deleted by the extract/clean step, so any teardown
    /// that shells out to it is racing its own removal.
    ///
    /// So retirement talks to the SCM directly, from inside the installer process —
    /// no dependency on the retired binary existing at all.
    ///
    /// ── Elevation ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ///
    /// This usually runs NON-elevated, and deregistering a service needs admin rights,
    /// so retirement is opportunistic: it happens when the process already has the
    /// rights (the repair flow), and is skipped otherwise.
    ///
    /// It must stay that way. The installer is <c>asInvoker</c> because the install is
    /// per-user — VSTO registers under HKCU and the WebView2 webcache dir needs runtime
    /// write access as the real user — and elevating this process would make
    /// %LOCALAPPDATA% and HKCU resolve against the approving admin, sending the whole
    /// install to the wrong profile. So do NOT add a UAC prompt or a <c>runas</c> child
    /// here; see the notes in app.manifest and Build/nsis/KleiKodeshWrapper.nsi.
    /// Prompting for *cleanup* would also be poor behaviour in its own right — it buys
    /// the user nothing.
    ///
    /// Skipping is safe because of what the retired service is: registered
    /// <c>SERVICE_DEMAND_START</c> and started only when a client opens its named pipe.
    /// Once the release that drops it stops opening that pipe, the registration is
    /// inert — it never runs, holds no file lock, uses no memory, and does not appear
    /// at boot. A stale SCM entry is the entire remaining cost.
    ///
    /// ── Ordering ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
