 *
 * Defined here — where the landing maths lives — and imported by the book-view
 * scroller and its top-line derivation, which must all agree on it: the sliver
 * means the line straddling the very top after a landing is the PREVIOUS line,
 * and a derivation that counts slivers resolves to the previous TOC entry.

 *   attempt. Use a resolver when flatItems can change between the call and the
 *   rAF (e.g. a new groups load completes mid-flight).
 *
 * After setting scrollTop, waits one rAF then re-resolves the index and
 * re-reads the measurement. If the measurement changed (item was estimated,
 * now DOM-measured with a different size), re-applies with the fresh target
 * and retries up to maxRetries total attempts.
 *
 * onScrolled: optional callback invoked once the scroll is confirmed stable.
 * isCancelled: optional function checked before each rAF.
