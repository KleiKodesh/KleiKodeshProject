# lines

Virtual-scrolled main text display for the book view. Handles line rendering, selection, and persistence.

## Components

**BookViewLinesContent.vue** - virtual-scrolled main text. Handles line selection, scroll position persistence, and communicates the selected line to the commentary panel. Any change to how lines are rendered or selected belongs here.

**BookViewAnnotationMenuRow.vue** - context menu row for highlight color selection and note editing. Uses `HIGHLIGHT_COLORS_LIST` from `bookViewAnnotationColors.ts`. Shows color swatches, an edit button for existing notes, and an eraser to clear highlights.

**BookViewNoteBubble.vue** - editable note bubble anchored to a note marker in the scroller. Positioned relative to the marker's DOMRect with smart viewport-edge flip.

**BookViewScrollbarTocTooltip.vue** - the current book-and-TOC-path label shown beside the pointer while it hovers the scrollbar track. Title leads on its own line, path beneath it in secondary colour; the title stands alone when no TOC entry covers the line. Height is observed via `useElementSize` with an explicit `{ box: 'border-box' }`, not measured once on mount — the component is not remounted per update, and the box resizes as a drag swaps in paths that wrap differently. The explicit border box matters twice over: it is the full painted height the centring wants, and it avoids the seed-vs-observed jump (`useElementSize` seeds from `offsetHeight`, then switches to the requested box on the first ResizeObserver fire) that would otherwise drop the label by half its chrome one frame in. Same trap as `useBookViewToolbarOverflow`. A plain Teleported label with `pointer-events: none`, clamped to the viewport and hung off the scrollbar's inner edge so it reads into the page.

**BookViewAbbrevTooltip.vue** - compact tooltip showing dictionary expansions for a selected abbreviation. All senses on one wrapped line, divider-separated; positioned above the selection with viewport flip. Keyed by lookup id so each new selection remounts and re-measures.

## Composables

**useBookViewLinesTable.ts** - paginated line fetching in chunks of 200. `ensureLines(start, end)` resolves once a range has its text — the WindowedScroller asks for every range before mounting it, so no row is ever rendered without content. `holdBackfill()`/`releaseBackfill()` pause and resume the full-book backfill queue (out-of-band `prefetch`/`ensureLines` fetches keep working while held). The backfill queue and its workers stop on unmount — a switched-away tab must not keep flooding the data channel while the next mount loads.

**useBookViewLinesBackfillGate.ts** - makes the full-book backfill yield to commentary loading (the "commentary loads slowly on tab return" bug). Held from setup so the tab-return flood cannot start before the restored commentary panel gets on the wire; re-held whenever a commentary load starts; released a short grace after each load settles, when no commentary panel is being restored, when the panel closes, or on a per-hold safety timeout (in-book search must never be starved of the full book).

**useBookViewLineRenderer.ts** - line content rendering with diacritics filtering, divine name censoring, and search highlighting. Caches rendered HTML per line to avoid re-running expensive transformations on every render cycle.

**useBookViewLineCopyMenu.ts** - context menu for copying selected lines with optional source attribution. Provides three copy modes: block copy (selected HTML as-is), copy with source appended inline as "(Book Title, TOC Path)", and copy with source prepended as an `<h2>` block. The source is built from `getActiveTocEntry()` and `getTocPath()` for the selection's first line, falling back to `tabStore.activeTab.tocPath` for the live scroll position.

**useBookViewLineLink.ts** - the "העתק קישור לקטע זה" context menu action. Builds the deep link (`buildLineLink` in `@/utils/appDeepLink`, the one place the
scheme and URL shape are defined: `kitveihakodeshapp://book/<bookId>?index=<lineIndex>`) — deliberately shaped like the `otzaria://open/book/<bookId>?index=<lineIndex>` links `HostLink.cs` already parses, with `index` meaning a 0-based positional line index in both — for the line the user pressed to open the menu (recorded on pointerdown, since both right-click and long-press begin with one) and copies it to the clipboard with a toast. The app does not register a handler for the scheme — the format is future-proofing only. `HostLink.cs` still parses the previous `seforimapp://` spelling so links already copied keep opening.

**useBookViewScrollbarTocTooltip.ts** - shows the reader's CURRENT book title and full TOC path while the pointer hovers the scrollbar track — reaching for the scrollbar is when "where am I?" gets asked. The path is the same wherever on the track the pointer sits; it deliberately does not read the position under the pointer. Position comes from `readCurrentPosition().lineIndex` (the first visible row), which `getActiveTocEntry`/`getTocPath` turn into the displayed path; title and path stay separate fields so the label can weight them, and so the title alone can answer when no TOC entry covers the line. `refreshScrollbarTocTooltip()` is called from the scroller's `@scroll` so a thumb drag — when the path changes fastest and the pointer is not moving — keeps the label current instead of frozen on a stale section. Positioned off the scrollbar's own geometry (`offsetWidth - clientWidth`, side from the resolved `direction`), so it follows the RTL scrollbar to the physical left. Hovering the track also REVEALS the bar when the hidden-scrollbars mode is on, via `revealScrollbarOnHover` in `useUiChromeVisibility`: that mode only tints the bar transparent and always reserves the gutter, so a hidden bar is still present, hoverable and draggable — just unseen, and labelling a position beside an invisible bar would be the worse half of the answer. The reveal fires immediately, ahead of the label's hover-intent delay, and a ~400ms keepalive re-arms it while the pointer rests on the track, since the reveal lingers only ~1s from its last call and `mousemove` stops firing the moment the pointer stops. `mousemove` fires constantly while reading, so the hit test is two-stage and the reading path stays off the layout: the event target must be the scroller itself (one reference comparison), then the pointer must fall in the last known track band, and only then is the rect read fresh. Only the bar's width and side are cached (the `getComputedStyle` half, re-measured by a `useResizeObserver`); the RECT is deliberately never cached, because a ResizeObserver cannot see every way the scroller moves — flipping the toolbar between left and right reorders equal-width flex siblings and translates the scroller with its size unchanged. A stale band can only mis-reject a pointer that is on the track, never accept one that is not, and it is widened by the scroller's own width so even a full-pane translation cannot hide the track from it.

**useBookViewAbbrevTooltip.ts** - shows the abbreviation tooltip when the user selects a single complete word shaped like a Hebrew abbreviation (gershayim in the middle — רשב"א — or geresh at the end — מת'). Normalizes ״/׳/curly quotes to ASCII (the dictionary stores abbreviations with ASCII quotes only), strips nikud and surrounding punctuation, and rejects partial-word or multi-word selections. Attached prefix letters are handled via stripped candidates (מהשי"ת → השי"ת → שי"ת). Looks up via `dictAbbrevSenses` (dictionary DB only, never the seforim DB): exact headword matches for all candidates first, then `%candidate%` LIKE fallbacks. Produces display-ready sense labels (translations only — the term itself is not repeated). Dismissed when the selection collapses or the scroller scrolls.

**useBookViewAnnotations.ts** - orchestrator that encapsulates all annotation state: highlights, notes, note bubble overlay, and selection-to-line-offset conversion. Exposes `onHighlight`, `onClearHighlight`, `onAddNote`, `onMarkerClick` handlers. Most annotation entry points go through here rather than the sub-composables directly.

**useBookViewHighlights.ts** - manages user highlights for the currently open book. Loads highlights on mount, handles apply/clear with overlap rules, persists to `user_settings.db` via `userSettingsDb.ts`. Called internally by useBookViewAnnotations.

**useBookViewNotes.ts** - manages user notes for the currently open book. Lazy viewport-driven loading, create/update/delete mutations with immediate in-memory map updates. Called internally by useBookViewAnnotations.

**useBookViewLinesNavigation.ts** - programmatic scroll navigation. `scrollToLine(index, {occurrence, force, skipIfVisible})` is the one scroller every jump goes through (TOC click, section nav, search match, commentary jump); `scrollToLineId(id, fallbackIndex, options)` resolves a line id to its index over the same core. The slow path stabilizes the landing while late chunk loads shift the target.

**useBookViewLinesScroll.ts** - scroll position save and restore. Save: captures `firstVisible.index` (not the overscan item) and the pixel offset within that item; skips saves where the gap between scrollTop and firstVisible.start exceeds 2000px (stale mid-restore state). Restore: two-stage virtualizer-API-only approach — stage 1 calls `scrollToIndex` immediately with estimated heights, stage 2 fires when the target chunk loads, re-issues `scrollToIndex`, then tracks `item.start` in a rAF loop until stable (correcting each time background chunks above shift the layout), then applies the saved sub-line offset via `scrollToOffset` if it fits within the item's actual height. A post-stabilization watch handles late-loading chunks. Never sets `scrollTop` directly.

## Utilities

**bookViewAnnotationColors.ts** — highlight color palette matching Zayit's HighlightColors object. Exports `HIGHLIGHT_COLORS` (named map) and `HIGHLIGHT_COLORS_LIST` (ordered array). Colors are Material Design: yellow, green, blue, pink, orange.
