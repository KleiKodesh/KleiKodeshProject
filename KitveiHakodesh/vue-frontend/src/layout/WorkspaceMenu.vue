/**
 * The whole of workspace management, as a menu panel rather than a page.
 *
 * It used to be a destination - a tab, a home tile, Ctrl+9 - for a list that is only
 * ever a few short rows and is picked from mid-task, so it is a menu now: a flyout off
 * the nav rail and a submenu inside the hamburger menu. Both surfaces render THIS
 * component, the way both render `appNavItems`, so the two can never drift.
 *
 * Every mutation lives in `workspaceStore`. What is here is the rows and the three bits
 * of row-local state: which row is being renamed, which is confirming a delete, and the
 * new-name box.
 *
 * The whole menu is **one keyboard list**, and that includes the new-name box at the
 * bottom: the rows and the box are stops on a single up/down walk, so arrowing past the
 * last row lands the caret in the box and arrowing up out of it returns to the last row.
 * Treating the box as a stop rather than as a separate tab target is the point - a reader
 * creating a workspace is doing the same job as one picking one, and should not have to
 * change input device or hunt for a tab stop in between.
 *
 * On a row: Enter switches to it, Delete starts its delete confirmation, F2 starts a
 * rename. In the box: Enter creates. Home/End jump to the ends of the walk.
 *
 * While a row is asking "delete this?", that question owns both answer keys for as long
 * as it stands: **Enter deletes, Escape backs out**. Neither reaches its usual meaning
 * until the question is gone, which is the whole point of a confirmation - it would be a
 * poor one if the key the reader just pressed to raise it also answered it.
 *
 * `useListKeys` is deliberately NOT used here, though the rows still carry its
 * `data-nav-item` marker and its `is-focused` class so they look like every other list in
 * the app. That composable binds its listener to the container it is given and assumes the
 * container is what holds the focus - but this menu never holds focus. The host panel does
 * (`WorkspaceSubmenu` focuses itself on open), and the panel is this menu's PARENT, so
 * keydowns there bubble up and away and never reach a listener bound down here. The walk
 * is therefore driven by `onPanelKeydown`, which the panel calls on the element the focus
 * is actually on. A text field that owns its own caret keys is the other reason: `Home`,
 * `End` and the arrows have to mean something different while the caret is in the box.
 *
 * No surface of its own - the panel that hosts it paints the background, frame and
 * shadow, so it drops into either host unchanged.
