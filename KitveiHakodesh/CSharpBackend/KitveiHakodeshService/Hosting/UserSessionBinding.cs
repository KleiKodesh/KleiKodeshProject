/// The Windows-service bootstrap: wait for the first pipe client, bind the process to THAT
/// user's profile, then run the real data host inside this one.
///
/// Why a two-stage host. Running as LocalSystem, this process has no user of its own, but
/// everything the data host does at construction - resolve the seforim DB from the user's
/// registry, open it, start the index builders - needs one. The SCM must also see the
/// service "running" within seconds, so the wait cannot happen before the service reports
/// started. So the service starts with only this listener; the first connection tells it
/// who it serves (<see cref="UserProfile.BindToUser"/>), and only then is the data host built
/// and started. That first request is held and answered by the data host once it is up, so
/// the first caller sees an ordinary (slightly slower) reply.
///
/// When the data host stops itself (it restarts after a database-path change), the service
/// stops with it; the SCM shows it stopped and the next host to need it starts it again.
