///   - a saved registry path is used only when the file is actually THERE, so a moved or
///     deleted database no longer yields a stale path that fails later somewhere less obvious
///   - when nothing is found, the answer is null rather than a default path known not to exist
/// The DB_PATH environment override is gone with them: Core reads no environment variables, and
/// a developer changes the setting exactly like a user does.
