# Indexing/

Index construction and segment management.

## Overview

Implements an LSM-tree (Log-Structured Merge-tree) architecture for building and maintaining the full-text index.

## Architecture

```
Database Lines
      ↓
[Tokenizer] → Words + Positions
      ↓
[RAM Index] → In-memory hash map
      ↓
[Segment Writer] → Immutable segment files
      ↓
[Background Merge] → Compaction
```

## Key Concepts

**Segment:** Immutable index file pair. The `.dat` posting file is memory-mapped (`MemoryMappedFile`) for search — random-access reads land in the OS page cache with no `FileStream` seek/read overhead. The `.db` SQLite term-index is opened read-only via ADO.NET. The `.dat` file must be unmapped (handle disposed) before it can be deleted on Windows — the `SearchLease` / `ReaderWriterLockSlim` protocol enforces this: `IndexReader` disposes all `SegmentHandle`s before releasing its lease, and the merger only calls `File.Delete` after acquiring the exclusive write lock.

**Posting List:** Sorted list of document IDs for a term, encoded as:
- Delta encoding (differences between consecutive IDs)
- VarInt (variable-length integer) compression

**WAL (Write-Ahead Log):** Crash-safe buffer. If process crashes during indexing, recovery replays the WAL.

**Merge Policy:** Small segments are merged into larger ones to:
- Reduce file count
- Improve query performance
- Reclaim space from deleted documents

## Usage

```csharp
using (var store = new SegmentStore(indexPath))
using (var writer = new IndexWriter(store, dbConnection))
{
    writer.BuildIndex(
        limit: 0,  // 0 = all lines
        onProgress: n => Console.WriteLine($"{n} lines")
    );
}
```

## Thread Safety

- `IndexWriter` — Single-threaded for building
- `SegmentStore` — Thread-safe for concurrent searches
- `SegmentMerger` — Background thread for merging

## File Format

Segment files are binary with:
1. Header (version, metadata)
2. Term dictionary (sorted terms)
3. Posting lists (delta+varint encoded)
4. Footer (checksums)
