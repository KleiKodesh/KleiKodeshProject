# Documentation Guidelines

- Do not create markdown files to summarize work or document processes unless explicitly requested by the user
- This is wasteful, noisy, and pointless
- Focus on creating functional code and configuration files only
- Only create documentation when the user specifically asks for it or when it's essential for functionality
